# ExamPlus üíé
## [ power fly hackerthon   ]

## üéØ Overview

#### ‚Ä£ Given Problem statement:
Build a functional prototype of a platform that gives students an array of digital academic and social tools to stay engaged with their studies, peers and broader university community during pandemic.

#### ‚Ä£ Project Idea:
The COVID-19 Pandemic has changed the education system dramatically, with the distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. Even the exams are being held in a remote fashion. Thus, this project provides an integrated platform for the students as well as the teachers to conduct examinations digitally in a hassle-free manner. One can create, attempt and monitor tests, and maintain score records easily.
This project has been built solely during the period of **Microsoft Engage'21 Mentorship Program** conducted by Microsoft to provide mentorship and to enrich students with various software development techniques.
